# MEAN Stack User Authentication App
MEAN stack init project for when you need a web user authentication app.  
Intended to be used as a bootstrap project for when one needs a skeleton User Authentication app.  

## Requirements
+ MongoDB
+ Node v6+

Requires a MongoDB instance to be running to store user credentials and encrypted passwords.  

## Notes
To make this more self contained an SQLite module could be used, replacing all the mongoose requirements.  
However this is meant for my personal use, for when I need to quickly build a full MEAN stack app so I don't have to deal with all the initial plumbing work.  
Feel free to use/fork/update as you please.
